Board settings
    Clock settings, for both clocks

Purpose of both clocks

High frequency clock
    Uses
        Clock frequency
        UART, which is used for IO
        QSPI, which is used for flash communication

    Pll and divider can be used with both ring osc and external crystal



Low frequency clock
    Uses
        Machine clock/real time clock
        Time based interrupts

    Divider can be used for ring oscilattor


Ring oscilattor
    default
    large range of frequencies
    Less accurate, can varie during execution

External crystal
    Constant (with possible pll and div)
    constant frequency once turned on



toolchain   
    Compiler/assembler choice as opposed to using premade tools

    development purely on memory -> flash  
        Exclusion of double tap bootloader
