% The abstract gives a good overview of the projects main achievement and explains the setting

Throughout an undergraduate computer science degree, many operating system concepts are covered however many are not demonstrated practically to much depth. This project uses a bare metal system to implement a simple operating system from scratch to explore these concepts, and discussing how the use of a RISC-V system differs from an ARM system. The Sifive Hifive1 Rev B was used to successfully demonstrate a simple operating system that could schedule processes and interact with a user. Future work will attempt to implement different concepts and more interactive input and output, and implement a dynamic memory system to compare its performance in a limited system.
